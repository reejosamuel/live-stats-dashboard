Live Dashboard

So I got a long holiday and the goal was to learn something new. Off the top of my head was to try and learn action cable and the real time features introduced in Rails 5 and also try to pick up some basics on Docker.

Finally turned to a score monitoring tool.

Features / Tech used:

Action Cable / Realtime Web Sockets
Devise Authentication with custom Mobile number Login and SMS Authentication
Docker
